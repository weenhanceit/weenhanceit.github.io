    <p>
      Our principals have worked in a wide variety of environments, with a broad
      spectrum of software technology, and have direct experience in the whole
      project experience (management / design / coding / testing / delivering).
      You can take advantage of that experience to enhance your own internal capability
      or to outsource all or part of your software development projects.

      What {{ site.we_logo }}'ve Learned
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our years of experience have taught us some valuable lessons which we can bring
      to your organization.  {{ site.we_logo }}'ve seen a lot of changes in IT over our careers,
      but getting value from technology still depends on the skill of the people
      who are using it correctly to solve your business problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      {{ site.we_logo }}'ve learned that you can't provide solutions unless you understand the problem.
      So often we've seen the frustration that comes when the people with the business
      problem are forced to deal with the language of specifications and technical acronym
      spouters.  {{ site.we_logo }} want the end user to articulate the business problem and {{ site.we_logo }} will
      ensure the correct technical solutions are delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      {{ site.we_logo }}'ve learned that, in most projects, the objectives are changing as companies
      learn more about their market or as users create new ideas as the software evolves.
      {{ site.we_logo }} think it is critical that the project methodolgy can react to these changes as
      quickly as the changes are taking place.  Our <a href="/about/methodology.html">
      methodology</a> avoids the large software project syndrome of delivering
      ponderous solutions that are already out of date.
    </p>
    <p>
      {{ site.we_logo }}'ve learned that it is critical to break projects down into a series of working deliverables
      that users can begin working with.  In cases where large scale roll out is required, WE
      recommend starting with a proof of concept, where a sub-set of data or functionality
      can be used to work out the kinks in operations or user interface.

    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping projects small and agile, helps you stay in control of your software
      development.  With a series of small deliverables you can check that the
      whole process is meeting your needs, you can change focus, and you can reset priorites.
    </p>
    <h3>
      {{ site.we_logo }} Know How To Make Things Work
    </h3>
    <p>
      {{ site.we_logo }} know that it takes more than testing some code to provide a solution.  To
      be of real value, at some point you have to put your software into production.
      {{ site.we_logo }} have been delivering custom software solutions as well as products for
      many years. Often overlooked are the systems to support and
      maintain applications.  {{ site.we_logo }} can work with your internal group or you
      can outsource the operations to us.

    </p>
