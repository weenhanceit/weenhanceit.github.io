## The Solution
Our approach is built on modern agile methodologies
for delivering solutions.
Our first step is to listen.
It's your problem we want to solve,
but we can't solve it without understanding what it is.
We'll talk to you and your key people
to get a sense of what you need.


We build web sites that load and analyze data,
and deliver the insights to your business
in a useful way.

## Servers
We provide servers sized to your needs.
We can even adjust the size dyanmically,
so you only pay for what you need,
when you need it.

Our Linux system administrators have been running servers
for decades.

## Storage
We provide storage, as much as you need, when you need it.
By allocating from a large shared pool of storage,
your costs are reduced,
and provisioning more storage is easy.

## Networks
We connect your servers to each other and to the Internet.

## Databases
We have experienced database administrators (DBAs)
who can design useful databases,
and keep them running.
Your data will be backed up and secure.

## Web Servers
You shouldn't have to worry about your web site or application crashing
because of sudden surges in traffic. Our system administrators can
provide as many web servers as are needed to meet your demand.

## Applications
We use modern web development languages and frameworks.
With decades of experience in software development,
we can quickly deliver the system you ask for.

## DevOps
We deploy your application rapidly and easily
through automated processes.
We monitor your application continuously
and respond to problems before you even notice them.
By leveraging computers to help us do our job,
you get a stable,

## Application Development
We use modern web development frameworks and languages,
to give you applications that work the way our users expect them to.
We automate the testing of the application
("test driven development"),
so it's easy to enhance the application,
or fix bugs,
with the confidence that the application
still does everything it did before.
We use continuous integration and continuous delivery,
so you can see the progress we're making,
and so we're ready to deploy enhancements
as soon as you're ready for them.
