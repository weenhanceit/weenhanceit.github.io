A friend of ours manages a middleware team at a medium-sized business.
One of his goals for this year is to sign a contract with a "no-pants"
company.

A No-Pants company is a small team of good people,
who get the job done without the usual ceremony of enterprise IT companies.
The name comes from the image of some people sitting at home
in their bathrobes,
cranking out good code.

Some of us who have been in IT for a long time
will remember when a lot of IT was done but just such teams.
IT was complicated and very detail oriented.
The type of people who were good at it
were maybe a bit eccentric,
especially considering the dominant corporate culture at the time.
If you wanted to get something really amazing done,
you _had_ to look outside the usual list of suspects
for people who could get it done.

But as the goals of IT became more ambitious,
projects became too complicated for just one or two people to deliver.
You needed teams,
and the same people who were excellent with technology,
weren't so great at working with a big team.
Unfortunately,
the people who were great working with a big team,
weren't so great working with technology.
And frankly,
there weren't a lot of people out there
who could get a big team to produce positive business outcomes.

The result,
if we're uncomfortably honest,
is 30 years of cost overruns,
schedule slips,
and systems that cause more problems than they solve.

But something good has been quietly happening over the last 20 years.
IT people have been quietly building software,
sharing it amongst themselves,
and honing it based on feedback from users.
The result is tools, processes, and communities
that enable a small team
to produce results quickly and with low risk.

Since it's late, I leave it here.
But this weekend I'll write up why
now is the time
to look at "No-Pants"
operations to take your business to the next level.
