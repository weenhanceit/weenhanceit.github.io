Jade Systems Inc President Larry Reid and International Data Engineering Inc President Phil Carrillo recently announced a new joint venture that will be branded WE Enhance IT.

“WE Enhance IT is a vehicle that will allow us to bring the resources and experiences of two organizations to bear on our existing and future services and products.”  Mr. Reid stated.  “Both of our organizations are strongly committed to bringing high value, high quality solutions to Web Application development, data management and data analysis problems.  WE Enhance IT allows us to effectively double our experience and capability to deliver.”

“Larry and I have worked together on a number of successful major projects over the past 25 years and we understand what IT takes to develop and deliver software solutions,”  Mr. Carrillo said.  “Studies have shown, and our experience has been, that small focused teams are far more successful at delivering solutions that meet the client’s needs both on time and on budget.  Our methodologies lead to success because we believe in the importance of understanding the needs of our clients, we break down our projects into molecular deliverables that avoid the pitfalls of the ‘big project’ and we rigorously test our work.  This joint venture allows us to bring more resources and support to our clients, all while keeping the development team small and with the direct participation of the principals.”

Mr. Reid continued, “With modern tools and techniques, like Ruby on Rails, Javascript frameworks, and DevOps methods, businesses have a golden opportunity to realize a lot of value from a small investment. We're here to help them do that.”

Both principals have a strong commitment to their customers. “I do this because I love helping other people solve real problems. That's just the kind of service I believe in,” concluded Mr. Carrillo.
