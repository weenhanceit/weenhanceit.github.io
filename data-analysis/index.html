      Data Analysis
    </h1>
    <p>
      Daniel Keys Moran clearly outlines the challenges facing any project
      that involves data when he says that, "You can have data without information,
      but you cannot have information without data."
    </p>
    <h3>
      Cleaning and Organizing Data
    </h3>
    <p>
       In order to get information, you need data.  But before you can say that you
       'have' data you need to ensure that:
       <ul>
         <li>You can extract the data from one or more sources.</li>
         <li>
           The data that you extract is clean and well behaved.  This usually
           means that the data files are formatted properly.
         </li>
         <li>
           The data is not only clean, but it is also standardized.  This is particularly
           important if data matching is to take place.  It is harder to write matching
           algorithms if things like phone numbers or addresses are not in a consistent, standard format.
         </li>
         <li>
            There is a well designed place to store the data (a database) that
            allows for efficient access to the data.
         </li>
         <li>
           There are processes in place to efficiently induct the data into the database.
         </li>
         <li>
           (for applications where the database needs to be updated on a regular basis) There
           must be processes and procedures in place to ensure that new data may
           be inducted and merged with the existing database.
         </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The cleansing, standardization and induction of data is critical to your
      enterprise -- yet it is a function that is often underestimated or, as we've
      seen system architects do, airily dismissed as "implementation details".  Completing
      an application without attention to these steps is roughly equivalent to opening
      a new building but neglecting to connect all the plumbing correctly.  The building
      may look nice, but the problems that are accumulating in the basement will soon make
      the building uninhabitable.

    <p>
      {{ site.we_logo }} are well aquainted with the issues associated with getting your data cleaned, standardized and loaded into
      a well designed, tuned database.  {{ site.we_logo }}'re not afraid to get our hands dirty,
      and we'll work with you to bring together
      the data without generating a lot of work
      for your already overworked IT department.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Getting Information From Your Data
    </h3>

    <p>
      Digging insights out of your data is a two way street:
      you know your business,
      but you might not have the time or expertise
      to analyze the data.
      {{ site.we_logo }} have the tools, time, and expertise
      to analyze data,
      and the experience and maturity
      to understand your business needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Listen to your business problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze the data.
        {{ site.we_logo }}'ll show you correlations
        between significant business events and outcomes,
        so you can see if attendance at a marketing event leads to sales,
        or what causes you to lose customers.
        Often, analysis shows areas where data is missing.
        {{ site.we_logo }}'ll find that data in other systems,
        or we can develop new applications for you,
        to capture the missing data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Present the data.
        The insights are useless unless the right people see them.
        {{ site.we_logo }} provide intuitive dashboards and reports
        accessible from a browser,
        and visible to authorized users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Insights often lead to more questions.
        {{ site.we_logo }} repeat the above,
        as long as you continue to get value from our services.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Our business model isn't based on selling you expensive "big data" tools.
      {{ site.we_logo }} start with the basic tools:
      databases, web applications, and virtual servers,
      so your costs and risks are low.
      {{ site.we_logo }} can scale the server and storage capacity as needed.
      If the data analysis requires something beyond
      what a typical database can do,
      we use open source tools like Solr,
      avoiding a big up-front commitment of money,
      and the attendant risk.
      If you have really do have big data,
      we can scale out with Hadoop, Zookeeper, and other tools
      for large scale map-reduce processing.
