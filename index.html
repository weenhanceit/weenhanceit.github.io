        Data Services
      </h2>
      <p>
        We can collect, collate, clean, analyze, and distribute your data
        in a way that maximizes business value
        and reduces costs.
        Don't pay staff to manually massage data in Excel.
        Let us automate it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can bring our analytic capability to bear
        on your data to help you gain insights into your business,
        or to improve your services to your clients.

        We'll show you working software at frequent intervals,
        and you can stop paying us if you're not getting value.
        As a small company,
        we're only accountable to you, the customer,
        not to faceless shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        We handle the infrastructure and platform software,
        so you can get to solving your business problem quickly.
        You don't need to make a substantial investment
        before you even start to evaluate
        the viability of your idea.

        We Minimize Frustration
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because we use modern automated testing and devops techniques,
        we're not afraid of changing the software.
        If your business needs change,
        or if you have insights into your business needs
        through working with us,
        we can adapt.
        We won't ask you to trade off the functionality you really need,
        just because it would mean a lot of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're always in control.

        We Lower Barriers
      </h2>
      <p>
        We don't make our money pushing expensive proprietary software on you.
        Generally, we prefer to use well-supported open source solutions.
        You don't have to make a big investment to even get started.
        For many organizations,
        this greatly simplifies project start-up.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand the realities of working in the modern enterprise,
        and we can be flexible in finding a way to get you to a solution.
