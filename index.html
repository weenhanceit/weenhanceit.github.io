              Let's face it, software development is challenging.  Whether you are developing a custom application,
              providing a Decision Support System for your managers or modifying an off the shelf solution to meet
              your needs - you need the right technology, the right methodolgy and, most importantly, the right
              people so that you avoid the pitfalls that sink many software projects.

            <div class="card-block">
              Your delivery team needs to have the technical expertise to complete the job
              as well as the experience to understand the business problem and deliver a quality solution.  This becomes
              acutely important when the project objectives are evolving or changing - developers
              need to be engaged with the users, not hidden behind a wall of specifications.
