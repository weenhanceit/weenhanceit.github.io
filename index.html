    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      Nowadays, most businesses have a lot of data.
      The problem typically is that it's locked up in systems
      that don't exactly make it easy to analyze.
      Our experienced technologists
      use modern tools
      to collect, consolidate, and analyze your data.

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>
      By analyzing your data,
      you can come up with insights about your business.
      Our senior technologists have run business
      and worked in the enterprise IT world
      for many years.
      We understand what businesses need,
      so you can talk to us about what you need to know about your business,
      not what we want to do with the technology.

      At the end of the day,
      you shouldn't buy a service unless you get
      a good return on investment.
      Because we're a boutique shop and our owners are hands-on,
      we're motivated by what you need,
      not like other consultants who have to meet
      their shareholders' needs.
