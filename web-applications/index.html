      Web Applications
    </h1>
    <p>
      Web applications take advantage of the the Web
      to make powerful and useful applications available
      to people
      in a way never seen before.
      Now the mobile Web on our phones and tablets has made
      these applications available to us everywhere.
      Anyone with a smart phone can find pretty much any information
      at any time, via Google searches, Wikipedia, or many other sources.
      Not only can we find information,
      we can learn, watch movies, play games, pay bills, do our banking,
      and any number of other tasks.
      Web apps are particularly suited to database applications
      since such apps allow all users have access to the latest dataset
      and problems associated with data synchronization can be greatly simplified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, many businesses are struggling
      to take advantage of these applications
      to reach that level of sharing, learning, and doing -
      both internally and with their customer base.
      There are many good reasons for this,
      but basically, it's expensive and risky to develop applications
      that work and that are easy to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last five to ten years,
      modern Web development frameworks,
      open source software,
      and cloud based platforms,
      among other things,
      have made it much easier, faster and cheaper,
      to develop Web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      But developing a Web application means so much more than “throwing up a web site”.
      You need developers that understand your business,
      know how to apply the new technologies,
      and follow the methodologies that allow you to manage the application development
      and avoid out of control software projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have the experience and the track record to develop Web Applications that work.
      Applications that bring the power of the Web to the internal or external operations of medium and even small-sized businesses.
      We use small teams that take advantage of the latest tools to deliver quality, usable software.
      Small teams are more productive than big teams, because less time is wasted communicating between team members.

      We Can Help You Get Your Application On Line Quickly and Efficiently
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our experience has taught us that each Web application project presents
      unique challenges.  Some apps have well defined functionality, while others may
      need more function development.  Some apps require working closely with users
      to develop a good human interface.  Some projects are looking for extra resources
      to work on an particular feature or enhancement, others prefer to outsource the
      entire development and operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first priority becomes understanding your challenge and proposing a way of working
      together to meet your objectives.  We like to break down our projects into
      managable pieces so that you can easily monitor the progress without feeling
      that you have been stuck in a morass of the big software project.  In cases where
      functionality is not well defined, we recommend starting with smaller, proof of
      concept projects, so that functions are well defined before committing to the
      higher costs of production releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use modern web development frameworks and languages, to give you applications
      that work the way your users expect them to. We automate the testing of the
      application (“test driven development”), so it’s easy to enhance the application,
      or fix bugs, with the confidence that the application still does everything it did
      before. We use continuous integration and continuous delivery, so you can see the
      progress we’re making, and so we’re ready to deploy enhancements as soon as you’re ready for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can take advantage of availability of cloud resources to house your application.  These
      resources are scaled to meet your requirements so that you can deploy your application
      efficiently, reliably, quickly, and at a reasonable cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can operate your application for you, or we can interface with your internal resouces
      so that you can run the application yourself.  When we are responsible for application operations,
      we deploy your application rapidly and easily through automated processes.  We monitor your
      application continuously and respond to problems, often before you even notice them. By
      leveraging computers to help us do our job, you get a stable, reliable application that's easy to enhance and fix.
