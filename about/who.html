    <p>
      One of the founding principles of {{ site.company_name }} is an understanding and belief in the efficiency of small teams and pair programming.
      {{ site.we_logo }} ensure that our projects are manageable, measurable and our clients have a clear understanding of what they are getting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our principal consultants have seen how large development projects can easily go off the rails.
      Organizations with large pools of coders that are "on the bench" are often anxious to utilize
      these coders, whether or not this is right for the client and the project.  Our experience has
      been that large projects mean large inefficient teams, cost overruns, missed deliverables, poor
      client communication, specification misunderstanding and unhappy customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At {{ site.company_name }}, we keep our teams small and effienct - our principal consultants
      remain personally involved and we draw on partners to build
      the right team at the right size.
    </p>
    <p>
      {{ site.we_logo }} believe in meeting our commitments.  {{ site.we_logo }} believe in quality: our work is tested and reliable. {{ site.we_logo }} don’t take short cuts.
      As Larry puts it “if you don’t have time to do it right, then you certainly don’t have time to do it wrong”.
    </p>
