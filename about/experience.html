    <h3>
      We Know Data
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most of our projects have included at least some requirement to manage, store
      or report on data.  The systems and tasks associated with the management of data
      are often overlooked or underestimated -- yet having clean data is usually a
      critical requirement for the success of such projects.   We know how to gather
      data, clean data, standardize data, store data, and retrieve data so that your
      application runs accurately and efficiently.
