    <h2>
      {{ site.we_logo }} bring methodology
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our approach is built on modern agile methodologies for delivering solutions.
      As the Agile Manifesto says,
      “Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
      through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”
      {{ site.we_logo }} value customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first step is to listen.
      It's your problem {{ site.we_logo }} want to solve,
      but {{ site.we_logo }} can't solve it without understanding what it is.
      We'll talk to you and your key people to get a sense of what you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding is a two way street.
      That's why we'll start to show you working, useful software early.
      {{ site.we_logo }} use the techniques of test driven development,
      continuous integration,
      and continuous delivery to be able to rapidly and frequently show you working software.
      (This is how Amazon can push changes to their web sites on average every nine seconds.)
      Modern web frameworks like Ruby on Rails and React
      allow us to deliver web applications rapidly,
      reliably,
      and on whatever device you need it: phone, tablet, laptop, or workstation.
      {{ site.we_logo }} don't need a long,
      drawn out analysis phase,
      because {{ site.we_logo }} can produce working software quickly and cheaply.
    </p>
    <p>
      {{ site.we_logo }} don't believe in reinventing the wheel.
      In fact, we're big on the benefits of sharing.
      {{ site.we_logo }} use open source software and the ecosystems around them
      to maximize what {{ site.we_logo }} can do for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A direct benefit to you from open source is avoiding large investments up front,
      before you even know if the software will do what you want.
      For example, if we're working with you
      and {{ site.we_logo }} discover that your application doesn't require a big data tool like Solr,
      {{ site.we_logo }} simply switch you to a traditional Postgres database.
      No wasted investment, and no pressure to stay on a tool that doesn't meet your needs.
    </p>
